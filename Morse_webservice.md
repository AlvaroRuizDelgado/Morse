# Morse WebServervice


### Ansible set-up
    - Python web app.
    - Database node + web server node â€”> morse encoder
    - Test is just to decode the morse code and see that it fits.

### Flow

- [x] Test python webservice
    - [x] Python program: mogi_morse.py
    - [x] WSGI
        - [x] Install Flask
        - [x] Hello world example
    - [x] Put it in an Openstack node and access it.
    - [x] Git integration
- [x] Update the program in the Flask Framework
      Needs text field and trigger button.
- [x] Take it down, re-create it.
- [x] Re-create it through HEAT.
- [ ] Configure it through Ansible
- [ ] Make morse database.
- [ ] Update HEAT and Ansible templates.
- [ ] Modify the python program to use the database.
      I can make a list of characters, grab only those from the database, and map them to a dictionary.
- [ ] Update it through Ansible.
- [ ] Add a Jenkins based test to check that the result can be decoded into the original text.
- [ ] FFS: docker

## Miscellaneous stuff happening

- [x] I wasn't sure how to access the server I created in the OpenStack machine. The options I saw are listed below (note that none would allow for icmp to work). In the end SSH port redirection is the easiest and the one that has the least impact.
    - VPN.
    - OVS bridge configuration.
    - SSH port redirection --> just add LocalForward in the .ssh/config file.
    - Configure apache2 with virtual addresses.
- [x] I had a problem with the security group, I wasn't letting servers access each other (TCP 5000 wasn't allowed).
- [ ] Check the run.py executable, I'm confused about the naming conventions.
- [x] When I create a stack through Heat, it always takes a couple of days until I can use the functionality, and then it works correctly --> the problem is in my .ssh/config, or more precisely, in when it is reloaded.
  - [ ] Closing and opening the terminal application solves the issue, as it loads the .ssh/config file, but there should be a less clunky way to do it.
  - [x] When creating a stack through Heat, I sometimes get a situation in which the ssh tunnel doesn't work, and all I get is an empty reply from server --> this is the same problem as above.
  ```bash
  Channel 13: open failed: connect failed: Connection refused
  ```
- [ ] Heat:
  - [x] The user_data is not executed. I found that it is copied into a folder though --> it was executed, but it was in the root folder (I expected it in the user folder).
  - [x] A stack with SOFTWARE_CONFIG user_data remains forever in the "building" state, until it is deemed "failed" for taking too long --> fixed if I don't use deployment.
  - [ ] If I use deployment, the user data doesn't run, and the creation remains in progress until it fails.
